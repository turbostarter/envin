## `process.env`

Validating envs are quite easy and can be done in a few lines of code. You can also infer the result from the validation onto your `process.env` object to benefit from autocompletion throughout your application as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1im-hMlKhM).

```ts twoslash
import { z } from "zod";

const envVariables = z.object({
  DATABASE_URL: z.string(),
  CUSTOM_STUFF: z.string(),
});

envVariables.parse(process.env);

declare global {
  namespace NodeJS {
    interface ProcessEnv extends z.infer<typeof envVariables> {}
  }
}

const url = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
//    ^?
```

Although, it's missing a few important features like extendable presets, differentation of server and client envs, robust error handling and more.

## t3-env

`envin` is highly inspired by [t3-env](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env) and shares the same philosophy of being framework-agnostic and providing a simple and easy to use API.

It enhances the experience of t3-env by solving most common issues reported by the community (e.g. about presets) and adding a CLI with a live preview on top of it.

## envkit

[Envkit](https://github.com/onboardbase/envkit) is a framework-agnostic environment variable management toolkit that focuses on developer onboarding experience.

Its standout feature is providing a beautiful, customizable UI fallback when environment variables are missing, making it particularly valuable for teams where new developers need to quickly get up and running.
