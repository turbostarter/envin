## The Problem

Forgetting environment variables during build can be a hassle and difficult to debug if a bug is caused by a missing environment variable.

You probably already implemented some form of environment variables validation in your app. It could be a simple check against the schema, but when your application grows, the complexity of the configuration grows with it.

This library aims to move that complexity into a library that abstracts the implementation details and lets the user focus on just the necessary parts. It also allows other framework and stacks to benefit from the same validation strategy - which we've polished over a number of iterations up until now.

## Current drawbacks

Validating envs are quite easy and can be done in a few lines of code. You can also infer the result from the validation onto your `process.env` object to benefit from autocompletion throughout your application as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1im-hMlKhM).

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

const envVariables = z.object({
  DATABASE_URL: z.string(),
  CUSTOM_STUFF: z.string(),
});

envVariables.parse(process.env);

declare global {
  namespace NodeJS {
    interface ProcessEnv extends z.infer<typeof envVariables> {}
  }
}
```

There are also a number of libraries that provide a more opinionated approach to environment variables validation like [t3-env](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env), but they all have some drawbacks that we're addressing here.
